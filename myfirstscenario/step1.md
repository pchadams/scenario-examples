A Katacoda scenario is a series of Markdown files, bash scripts and a JSON file to define how your scenario should be configured, the text for the scenario and any automation required.

## Task
Pablos first step

The scenario you are currently reading is in the directory `ls -lha scenario-examples/`{{execute}}. The directory name is what defines the URL.

An example of the current step is `katacoda-scenario-examples/create-scenario-101/step1.md`{{open}}

All the steps are collected via a JSON file, for example, `katacoda-scenario-examples/create-scenario-101/index.json`{{open}}.

The JSON file defines the scenario title, the description, steps order, the UI layout and environment. You can find more about the layouts within our scenarios at [katacoda.com/docs/scenarios/layouts](https://katacoda.com/docs/scenarios/layouts) and environments at [katacoda.com/docs/scenarios/environments](https://katacoda.com/docs/scenarios/environments).
